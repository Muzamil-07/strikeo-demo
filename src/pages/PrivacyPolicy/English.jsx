          StrikeO prioritizes the security of user information through a
          multi-faceted approach. To ensure the confidentiality and integrity of
          personal data during transmission, cutting-edge encryption protocols
          and software are employed. Compliance with the Payment Card Industry
          Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is integral to our handling of credit
          card data, reinforcing a secure environment for financial
          transactions. Our commitment extends to maintaining physical,
          electronic, and procedural safeguards, with occasional identity
          verification requests enhancing security measures. Devices used on our
          platform are fortified with security features, allowing users to
          configure settings according to individual needs. For detailed
          guidance, users can access information on managing device security

          actively mitigating risks and fostering a protected digital space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are reminded of their responsibility in ensuring the security of
          their personal information. Vigilance against unauthorized access to
          passwords, coupled with safeguarding computers, devices, and
          applications, is crucial. A fundamental best practice includes signing
          off when finished using shared devices. This collective approach,
          combining robust security measures implemented by StrikeO and user
          adherence to best practices, establishes a secure and trustworthy
          environment for all users. The commitment to data security is evident

          VI. Advertising Practices
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          StrikeO Services may incorporate third-party advertising and links to
          external websites and applications. Interactions with the content,
          advertising, and services provided by third-party advertising partners
          on StrikeO may result in the collection of information about users. To
          gain a comprehensive understanding of third-party advertising on
          StrikeO, including interest-based ads, users are encouraged to review
          the <mark>Interest-Based Ads policy.</mark> For customization of
          advertising preferences, users can visit the{" "}
          <mark>Advertising Preferences page.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the utilization of third-party advertising services, StrikeO
          furnishes advertising companies with data enabling the delivery of
          more pertinent and valuable ads, along with assessing their efficacy.
          It is imperative to note that no direct identifiers, such as names,
          are shared during this process. Instead, an advertising identifier,
          such as a cookie or device identifier, is utilized, applying
          irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address.
          For instance, if an app has been previously downloaded, the
          advertising identifier and associated data are shared to prevent
          redundant ad displays. Additionally, some advertising companies
          leverage this information to present users with relevant ads from
          other advertisers. Users seeking to opt-out of interest-based
          advertising can access the Advertising Preferences page for detailed
          guidance.
