        personal data during transmission, cutting-edge encryption protocols and
        software are employed. Compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data

        security measures. Devices used on our platform are fortified with
        security features, allowing users to configure settings according to

        VI. Advertising Practices
      </Typography>
      <Typography fontSize={14} pb={1}>
        StrikeO Services may incorporate third-party advertising and links to
        external websites and applications. Interactions with the content,
        advertising, and services provided by third-party advertising partners
        on StrikeO may result in the collection of information about users. To
        gain a comprehensive understanding of third-party advertising on
        StrikeO, including interest-based ads, users are encouraged to review
        the <mark>Interest-Based Ads policy.</mark> For customization of
        advertising preferences, users can visit the{" "}
        <mark>Advertising Preferences page.</mark>
      </Typography>
      <Typography fontSize={14} pb={1}>
        In the utilization of third-party advertising services, StrikeO
        furnishes advertising companies with data enabling the delivery of more
        pertinent and valuable ads, along with assessing their efficacy. It is
        imperative to note that no direct identifiers, such as names, are shared
        during this process. Instead, an advertising identifier, such as a
        cookie or device identifier, is utilized, applying irreversible
        cryptography to other information like an email address. For instance,
        if an app has been previously downloaded, the advertising identifier and
        associated data are shared to prevent redundant ad displays.
        Additionally, some advertising companies leverage this information to
        present users with relevant ads from other advertisers. Users seeking to
        opt-out of interest-based advertising can access the Advertising
        Preferences page for detailed guidance.
