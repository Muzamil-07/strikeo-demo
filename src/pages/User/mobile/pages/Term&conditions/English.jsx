          StrikeO's Role
        </Typography>

        <Typography fontSize={14}>
          StrikeO facilitates third-party sellers in listing and selling their
          products on the StrikeO Store. While facilitating transactions on the
          StrikeO Store, StrikeO is neither the buyer nor the seller of the
          seller's items. The contract formed upon completion of a sale for
          third-party products is solely between the buyer and the seller.
          StrikeO acts as a venue for negotiations and transaction completion.
          Consequently, StrikeO is not a party to this contract, does not assume
          any responsibility arising from it, and is not the seller's agent
          (except for the limited purpose of acting as the seller's payments
          collection agent). When StrikeO receives sale proceeds, the buyer
          satisfies obligations to the seller. The seller is responsible for
          product sale and addressing buyer claims or any other issues arising
          from the contract between the buyer and seller. For a safer buying
          experience, StrikeO provides the buyers contractual or other rights
          and remedies against the seller or any other party.
